### 🔍 Deep Summary & Context
This paper is the birth of the Transformer model. By removing recurrence entirely and relying solely on attention, it achieved state-of-the-art results while being significantly more parallelizable. This shift enabled the training of massive models like GPT-4 and Gemini.

### 💡 Key Concepts
- Self-Attention Mechanism: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data.
- Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Foundations for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- Multi-Head Attention: Parallelizing attention to capture different aspects of the data.

### 🎓 Study Points (What to focus on)
- Why did Transformers replace RNNs/LSTMs in NLP?
- Mathematical derivation of Scaled Dot-Product Attention.
- The role of Positional Encoding in non-sequential processing.
